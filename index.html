          CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL, pronounced C-F-O-P or C-fop) is a 3x3
          speedsolving method proposed by several cubers around 1981. It is also
          known as the Fridrich Method after its popularizer, Jessica Fridrich.
          In part due to Fridrich's publication of the method on her website in
          1995, CFOP has been the most dominant 3x3 speedcubing method since
          around 2000, with it and its variants used by the vast majority of the
          top speedcubers such as Feliks Zemdegs, Max Park, Sebastian Weyer,
          Mats Valk, etc.

          Roux (French: [ʁu], English: [ɹuː] ROO) is a Rubik's cube speedsolving
          method invented by Gilles Roux. Roux is based on Blockbuilding and
          Corners First methods. It is notable for its low movecount, lack of
          rotations, heavy use of M moves in the last step, and adaptability to
          One-Handed Solving.

          The ZZ method is a 3x3 speedsolving method created by Zbigniew
          Zborowski in 2006. The method is focused both on low move count and
          high turning speed; during the majority of F2L, the solver only needs
          to make L, U, and R moves, which means that the solver's hands never
          leave the left and right sides of the cube, resulting in faster
          solving. In addition, edges are already oriented when the solver
          reaches the last layer, meaning the solver has fewer cases to deal
          with. The method, including both EOLine and EOCross, was originally
          proposed in 2003 by Ryan Heise on the Yahoo! Group in this post.
          However, it became popular and associated with Zbigniew Zborowski
          after he independently created the method in 2006 and developed a
          website.
